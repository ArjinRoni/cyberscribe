# CyberScribe Transcriptor

A transcription tool created by Claude Sonnet and Arjin, CyberScribe helps to make more efficient human - AI interaction, often constrained by the discrepancy btw human token creation and deployment speed. It helps us meetsacks communicate with text based llm interfaces faster. You can instantly record your brainstorming / thoughts sesh / long prompt, or intended communication with any llm and paste it into any text box. It also accepts audio and video files, for example WhatsApp audio messages, or iphone / phone recordings. 

humans speak at ~150 Word Per Minute but type only ~50 WPM. This blocks reasoning / articulation steps as well. 

 Simply speak, transcribe, and paste into any LLM your output after loading the transcription model. I use base but better computers can use small.
